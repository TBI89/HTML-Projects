    <p>Once youve got a handle on the different types of plants - bulbs, annuals, perennials, shrubs and trees - you can
        start to put them together to gorgeous effect. But first, you need to decide on your planting style.</p>

    <p>The top mistake that novice veg growers make is to grow too much. So start small - restrict yourself to a small
        salad patch, containers of veg on the patio or a small raised bed, then gradually expand your growing ambitions
        as time allows. Discover space-saving crops to grow.</p>
